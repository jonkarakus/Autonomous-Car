Completed by Jon Karakus 

Inspired by popular maze car challenges, the goal of this project was to create an autonomous car 
prototype that would be capable of navigating around household objects in an intelligent manner 
without any preset navigation commands. A combination of 6 sensors and 2 servo motors were used to complete 
this engineering task. Further iterations would implement simultaneous localization and mapping algos in order 
to map the environment while keeping track of the current location. 

This repository contains the code for the project as well as a hardware schematic I created using KiCAD.
