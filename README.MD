# Autonomous Car Prototype

## Project Overview

Completed by Jon Karakus, this project aims at developing an autonomous car prototype capable of intelligently navigating around household objects without any preset navigation commands. Inspired by the popular maze car challenges, a combination of 6 sensors and 2 servo motors are used to navigate through its environment.

The primary goal of this project was to create a foundational system for an autonomous vehicle that could be further enhanced with more sophisticated algorithms, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), to map the environment while keeping track of the vehicle's current location. Futher iterations would include the implementation of SLAM. 

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code:** Contains all the necessary code to program the microcontroller for autonomous navigation.
- **KiCAD Schematics:** A detailed hardware schematic of the prototype, I created using KiCAD, to assist in replicating or modifying the system.
